<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Hebei University of Technology, China. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Next Generation Electronic Information Technology at Xidian University, China. 

My research interest includes generative models and Transformer-based models, and I am also interested in large language models.
