<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Hebei University of Technology, China. Currently, under the guidance of Professor Yang liu, I am pursuing a master's degree in next-generation electronic information technology at Xidian University. 
My research interests mainly focus on zero-shot learning, 3D reconstruction, image recognition, and transformer-based models.

During my master's studies, I focused on compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL), and have made several contributions to this area.

[Multi-level Contextual Prototype Modulation for Compositional Zero-shot Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104968)

Yang Liu, **Xinshuo Wang**, Xinbo Gao, Jungong Han, Ling Shao

- We propose Multilevel Contextual Prototype Modulation (MCPM), a transformerbased framework with a hierarchical structure that effectively integrates attributes and objects to generate richer visual embeddings.

[Concept-Aware Graph Convolutional Network for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856526)

Yang Liu, **Xinshuo Wang**, Xinbo Gao, Jungong Han, Ling Shao

- We proposed a concept-aware graph convolutional network (GCN) that utilizes cross-attentions to extract features unique to attributes and objects from paired concept-sharing inputs.
